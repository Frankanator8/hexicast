Movement
W/Up Arrow -> Move North (what looks like top right)
S/Down Arrow -> Move South (bottom left)

To Cast a Spell:
Hold down your mouse, and trace out either the:
Top, bottom left, or bottom right sides of a hexagon
The moves are shown to the right, with the fire
move being highlighted

Sometimes, you need a secondary click (or you can start
the next spell) to initiate the spell (usually to
aim it). If a spell does not seem to initiate when
you cast it and the game verifies you casted it,
try clicking somewhere.
